Setup:

1. download and install any toolchain dependencies (see following toolchains section)
1. restart your IDE if it was already open
1. open the top-level CMakeLists.txt in either CLion or Visual Studio
1. Set up the toolchain

# Toolchain
On windows, there are a few different ways to build. First is using the Visual Studio toolchain (MSVC or Clang); and the
second is using MinGW/GCC.

## MinGW Toolchain Details
Need to install the 64bit version of mingw. The MinGW installation manager doesn't seem to support x64, so need to download just the plain installer: http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds

In the MinGW-w64 installation wizard, 
- make sure to select the required architecture to x86_64.  (Note that the default suggested option is 32-bit.)
- Set threads to posix (otherwise you won't have std::mutex etc)

For instructions on using the latter with CLion, see their [setup guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-windows.html).

(tl;dr, add a new MinGW toolchain with Environment: `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64`)
